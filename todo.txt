I ate a burrito and some fries, and I want to log it into my nutrition log. First, go to url nutritionlog.com. Iâ€™m already logged in, so I start a new log. I select the date, I enter what I ate and my mood, which is -10000000.  Then I click submit.  

	DONE entries#new 
	DONE Entry _form.html.erb
	DONE :food input field
	food input field 'autocompletey'
		Inject Jquery Autocomplete
		set listener on form input
		hit api with jquery autocomplete
	set hidden field ndbno
	submit to Entry#create
		params[:entry] = {
			"food": "burrito",
			"mood": "-10000",
			"date": "Feb 3, 2015"
			"ndbno_id": "34234"
		}
	query the ndb-api with ndbno
	with the responses we are going to add food-meta-data
	return_to logs#index
